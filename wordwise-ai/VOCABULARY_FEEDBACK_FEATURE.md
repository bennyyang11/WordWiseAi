# Vocabulary Feedback Feature

This feature provides personalized vocabulary analysis and suggestions based on the user's English proficiency level using OpenAI API.

## Overview

The vocabulary feedback system analyzes the user's writing and provides:
- **Level appropriateness score** (0-100)
- **Complex words** that might be too advanced for their level
- **Simple words** that could be upgraded for better expression
- **Personalized recommendations** for vocabulary improvement
- **Alternative word suggestions** with context

## Features

### 1. Proficiency-Based Analysis
- **Beginner**: Focus on basic everyday vocabulary (1000-2000 common words)
- **Intermediate**: Expanded vocabulary including academic terms (2000-5000 words)
- **Advanced**: Sophisticated vocabulary with complex academic and technical terms

### 2. Real-Time Feedback
- Automatically analyzes text when user types (minimum 20 words)
- Debounced analysis (1.5 seconds) to avoid excessive API calls
- Live regeneration when language settings change

### 3. Comprehensive Feedback Types

#### Overall Score
- 0-100 appropriateness score for vocabulary level match
- Indicates if vocabulary is suitable for user's proficiency

#### Word Classification

## Technical Implementation

### Service Architecture
```typescript
// vocabularyFeedbackService.ts
class VocabularyFeedbackService {
  async analyzeVocabulary(text: string, userProfile: UserProfile): Promise<VocabularyFeedback>
}
```

### OpenAI Integration
- Uses GPT-3.5-turbo with specialized vocabulary analysis prompts
- Tailored prompts based on user's proficiency level and native language
- JSON-structured responses for consistent parsing

### State Management
```typescript
// Added to writingStore.ts
vocabularyFeedback: VocabularyFeedback | null;
isGeneratingVocabularyFeedback: boolean;
setVocabularyFeedback: (feedback: VocabularyFeedback | null) => void;
setIsGeneratingVocabularyFeedback: (generating: boolean) => void;
```

### UI Integration
- Added as fourth section in the suggestions panel
- Color-coded feedback types (red for complex, yellow for simple, etc.)
- Compact design optimized for sidebar display
- Loading indicators during analysis

## Data Structures

### VocabularyFeedback Interface
```typescript
interface VocabularyFeedback {
  overallScore: number;           // 0-100 appropriateness score
  complexWords: VocabularyWord[]; // Words too difficult for level
  simpleWords: VocabularyWord[];  // Words too basic for level
  recommendations: VocabularyRecommendation[]; // Actionable advice
  levelAppropriate: boolean;      // Overall level match
  suggestedWords: VocabularySuggestion[]; // Alternative words
}
```

### VocabularyWord Interface
```typescript
interface VocabularyWord {
  word: string;                   // The flagged word
  position: { start: number; end: number }; // Position in text
  complexity: 'too-simple' | 'appropriate' | 'too-complex';
  explanation: string;            // Why it's flagged
  definition?: string;            // Word definition
}
```

## User Experience

### Visual Design
- **Purple theme** for vocabulary section to distinguish from other feedback types
- **Progress indicators** showing vocabulary level appropriateness
- **Color-coded categories**:
  - ðŸ”´ Red: Too complex words
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Too simple words
  - ðŸ’¡ Blue: Recommendations
  - âœ¨ Green: Better alternatives

### Interaction Flow
1. User types text (minimum 20 words required)
2. System automatically analyzes vocabulary after 1.5 seconds
3. Feedback appears in suggestions panel under "Vocabulary Analysis"
4. User can review complex/simple words and recommendations
5. Feedback updates when language settings change

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### Mock Data System
- Comprehensive mock feedback when OpenAI API unavailable
- Level-specific mock data for each proficiency level
- Realistic examples tailored to user's English level

### Graceful Degradation
- Falls back to mock data if API fails
- Validates API responses and provides defaults
- Handles malformed JSON responses from OpenAI

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### User Profile Requirements
- `englishLevel`: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'
- `nativeLanguage`: Used for culturally relevant examples

## Benefits for ESL Students

1. **Level-Appropriate Learning**: Vocabulary suggestions match current proficiency
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Gradual vocabulary building recommendations
3. **Context Awareness**: Suggestions consider academic vs. casual writing
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Examples relevant to native language background
5. **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time analysis helps build vocabulary awareness

## Future Enhancements

1. **Word Difficulty Database**: Local vocabulary complexity scoring
2. **Learning Tracking**: Track which vocabulary recommendations user follows
3. **Personalized Word Lists**: Generate study lists based on user's writing patterns
4. **Domain-Specific Vocabulary**: Specialized vocabulary for different fields
5. **Vocabulary Games**: Interactive exercises based on user's vocabulary gaps

## Example Output

For an intermediate-level student writing about technology:

### Complex Words Flagged
- "ubiquitous" â†’ Suggest: "common", "widespread"
