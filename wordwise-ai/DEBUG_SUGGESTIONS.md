# 🐛 Suggestion Synchronization Debug Guide

## 🔍 **Debugging the Issues:**

### **Issue 1: Error popup keeps appearing after acceptance**
- **Root Cause:** Re-analysis might be triggered multiple times
- **Fixed:** Removed forced re-analysis, letting natural debounced analysis handle it

### **Issue 2: Highlighted errors don't show in suggestions panel**
- **Root Cause:** Store synchronization issues between TextEditor and SuggestionsPanel
- **Debug:** Added extensive console logging to track store state

## 🧪 **Debug Test Steps:**

### **Step 1: Basic Highlighting Test**
1. **Open browser console** (F12)
2. **Click green "Test" button**
3. **Look for console messages:**
   ```
   🧪 Manual test button clicked
   🧪 Added manual test suggestions
   📋 Store state - suggestions length: 1
   🎨 Rendering highlights for 1 valid suggestions
   ```

### **Step 2: Store Synchronization Test**
1. **Click highlighted word** to open tooltip
2. **Click "Accept"**
3. **Look for console messages:**
   ```
   🧹 Clearing all suggestions from store after accepting: test
   ✅ Store cleared. Suggestions length should now be 0
   📭 No suggestions in store
   ```

### **Step 3: Panel Sync Test**
1. **Toggle suggestions panel** (bottom button)
2. **Check if panel shows same suggestions as highlights**
3. **Look for mismatch between panel and highlights**

### **Step 4: Real-time Analysis Test**
1. **Type:** "I goed to the store"
2. **Wait 1-2 seconds**
3. **Look for console messages:**
   ```
   ⚡ TextEditor: Starting real-time analysis
   ✅ TextEditor: Analysis completed - X suggestions found
   📝 Setting suggestions from real-time analysis
   ✅ Real-time suggestions set in store
   📋 Store state - suggestions length: X
   ```

## 🔧 **Console Commands for Testing:**

```javascript
// Create test suggestion manually
document.querySelector('button').click(); // Test button
```

```javascript
// Check current suggestions in store
console.log('Current suggestions:', window.store?.suggestions);
```

### **Clear All Suggestions:**
