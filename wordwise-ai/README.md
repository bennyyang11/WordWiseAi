## 🧪 Testing the Application

### Sample Text for Testing
Try typing this sample essay text to see WordWise AI in action:

```
I think that technology is very good for education. It can help students learning more better and make the education more interesting. Many schools are now using computers and internet to teach their students.

However, there is also some problems with technology in education. Some students might become too dependent on it and don't learn to think by themselves. Also, not all students have access to good technology at home.

In conclusion, I believe that technology can be helpful for education if we use it in the right way. Teachers should guide students how to use technology properly and make sure that all students have equal opportunities to access it.
```

This text contains various ESL-specific issues that WordWise AI will detect:
- Grammar errors ("learning more better", "some problems")
- Informal language ("very good", "don't")
- Vocabulary opportunities ("good" → "beneficial")
- Style improvements for academic writing

## 🎓 Educational Philosophy

WordWise AI is built on the principle that **learning should happen during the writing process**, not just after. Instead of simply marking errors, the tool:

1. **Explains the reasoning** behind each suggestion
2. **Provides examples** to reinforce learning
3. **Considers ESL-specific challenges** like interference from native language
4. **Promotes gradual improvement** rather than overwhelming corrections
5. **Builds confidence** through positive reinforcement
