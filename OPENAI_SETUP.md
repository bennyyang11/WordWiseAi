## ‚ú® What You'll Get

### AI-Powered Vocabulary Enhancement
- **Intelligent Context Analysis**: AI analyzes your entire text to understand context
- **Smart Vocabulary Upgrades**: Suggestions for more sophisticated, academic, or professional language
- **No Hardcoded Patterns**: AI can suggest improvements for ANY word, not just predefined ones
- **Context-Appropriate**: Different suggestions for essays, emails, reports, etc.
- **Blue Highlighting**: Vocabulary suggestions appear with blue underlines

### Example AI Suggestions
- "very good" ‚Üí "excellent" (academic writing)
- "get" ‚Üí "obtain" or "acquire" (formal context)
- "thing" ‚Üí "aspect" or "element" (precision)
- "a lot of" ‚Üí "numerous" or "substantial" (quantifiers)
- "help with" ‚Üí "assist with" (professional language)

## üîß How It Works

1. **Real-time Analysis**: As you type, OpenAI GPT-4 analyzes your text
2. **Three-Stage Process**:
   - Stage 1: Spelling check (word-by-word)
   - Stage 2: Grammar analysis (sentence-by-sentence)
   - Stage 3: **Vocabulary enhancement** (comprehensive AI analysis)
3. **Blue Highlighting**: Vocabulary suggestions appear with blue underlines
4. **Click to Accept**: Click highlighted words to see and accept AI suggestions

## üö® Important Notes

### Security
- Keep your API key private and secure
- Never share or commit your API key to version control
- The current setup uses `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` for development

### Fallback Mode
If no API key is provided, the system will use basic pattern matching for vocabulary suggestions with a note to "Upgrade to AI suggestions with OpenAI API key"

### Cost Considerations
- OpenAI charges per token used
- Typical usage for writing assistance is very affordable
- Monitor your usage at [https://platform.openai.com/usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage)

## üéØ Testing Your Setup

1. Start the application
2. Type some text like: "This is very good work with a lot of nice things"
3. Look for blue underlines on words like "very good", "a lot of", "nice", "things"
4. Click the blue underlined words to see AI-powered vocabulary suggestions
5. Check browser console for messages like "‚úÖ OpenAI analysis complete"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Suggestions Appearing
- Check that your API key is correct and starts with `sk-`
- Verify the `.env` file is in the `wordwise-ai` folder
- Restart the development server after adding the API key
- Check browser console for error messages

### API Key Errors
- Ensure you have credits available in your OpenAI account
- Verify your API key hasn't expired
- Check that your key has the correct permissions

### Fallback Mode Active
If you see "(Upgrade to AI suggestions with OpenAI API key)" in suggestions, it means the system is using basic patterns instead of AI. Double-check your API key configuration.

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your API key is properly set in the `.env` file
