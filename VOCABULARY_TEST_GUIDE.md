3. **Click the purple "🧪 Test Vocab" button** in the bottom toolbar (next to "Samples")
4. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab) to see detailed test results

### 📊 What to Expect

#### ✅ **If OpenAI API is Working (Best Case)**:

- **Blue underlines** appear on multiple vocabulary words
- **Click blue words** to see AI-powered suggestions like:
  - "very good" → "excellent"
  - "a lot of" → "numerous" 
  - "nice" → "pleasant"
  - "things" → "aspects"
  - "help" → "assist"
  - "get" → "obtain"

#### ⚠️ **If Using Fallback Mode (No API Key)**:
- **Console shows**: "⚠️ No OpenAI API key - using fallback vocabulary patterns"
- **Blue underlines** appear on basic words only
- **Suggestions include**: "(Upgrade to AI suggestions with OpenAI API key)"
- **Limited patterns** - only predefined word mappings

#### ❌ **If No Suggestions Appear**:
- Check console for error messages
- Verify the test text loaded properly
- Wait 3-4 seconds for analysis to complete

### 🔍 **Test Text Breakdown**

The test loads this text:
> "This is very good work with a lot of nice things to help people get better results. The big problem is that many students use simple words and don't show their knowledge properly. We need to make sure they understand how to use more sophisticated vocabulary in their academic writing."

**Expected Vocabulary Improvements**:
- `very good` → `excellent`
- `a lot of` → `numerous`
- `nice` → `pleasant/favorable`
- `things` → `aspects/elements`
- `help` → `assist`
- `get` → `obtain/achieve`
- `big problem` → `significant issue`
- `make sure` → `ensure`
- `use` → `utilize/employ`
- `show` → `demonstrate`
